*This is a simple file manager, with a set of functions that, it seems to me, can make it convenient.*
*This project is my term paper. According to this, it will definitely be brought to its logical conclusion.*

The author does not pretend in any way to the purity of implementation and fidelity of execution. 
So if you think you can do it in a different way, then please do it.

At this stage, the project is launched by cloning this repository and building locally using the installed meson build system.

**Steps:**
1. install meson
2. clone the repository
3. run: meson setup build
4. run the script: . run

Tests are written out of necessity and in the presence of the right mood! But you can always fix it. :)
